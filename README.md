# Python_SQL

"""
These files are classes that I had to create quickly to use Python for CRUD operations to access a DB I created in AWS for a project I am working on.
My first files for this were PHP files, but our front end wasn't able to handle the PHP files due to the server being unable to compile PHP code. This
is the first time I've used Python to access SQL and I understand this isn't optimal, but was necessary to get the job done.  I am going to attempt the
same thing with TypeORM next.  Thanks for checking this out!
